# Homework: Module 1 - What is an API?

## Hands-On Assignment 

Describe how an API for our school will be used to support the school’s business operations. The scope of the project is to create a minimally viable product (MVP) of an API that supports online course registration for our school. Describe the uses of the API such as supporting mobile and web-based course registration as well as supporting other business applications that the school may develop in the future.

## Product Description 

The New Jersey Institute of Technology is looking to create a minimally viable product of an API that supports course registration. With an API in mind for course registration, there a few functionalities that must be present. For example, when it comes to the architectural style of registration data, we want to keep REST in mind. To look at it simply: 

•	We want school personnel to be able to create course schedules and present them to the students (POST/PUT)

•	We also want students to be able to read what classes are available and posted (GET)

•	Update: Student registration will be a part of updating the database. Showing changes for students and teachers schedule together who have added classes. (PUT/POST/PATCH)

•	Delete: Student registration will be a part of updating the database. Showing changes for students and teachers schedule together who have removed classes. (Delete)


With REST, applications have the ability to be built around resources decreasing the number of constraints that can be present during development. With that being said since we are also going beyond the scope of just creating a web best registration. We also want to keep in mind that we want to support mobile applications and other business applications that may be developed in the future. Perfect reason why RESTful APIs are the best option. With the ability to distribute the data of these APIs over the internet. This gives developers the ability to modify these applications due to their scalability over time. For example, a scalable application that can be created is a tool that allows students and teachers to discuss class material posted for each lecture. Previewing the notes from that day, and having students posting discussions about that lecture. With REST, applications will be more simplified, reliable and portable overtime.
